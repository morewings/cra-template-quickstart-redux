This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Quickstart Redux Template](https://github.com/morewings/cra-template-quickstart-redux).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

 This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.

### `yarn lint` 

This is an extra from template. Lints project files according to eslint rules, see below. Typical usecase: continuous integration environments, Travis, CircleCI, etc.

### `yarn fix`

Same as `yarn lint`, but also fixes errors, when possible. Typical usecase: local development environment, git hooks.
