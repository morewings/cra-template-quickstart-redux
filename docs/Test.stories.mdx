# Testing

Snapshot testing done with [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro). Example tests are included. Redux connected components are tested with [redux-mock-store](https://github.com/dmitry-zaets/redux-mock-store).

## Caveats

- If pre-commit hooks not work (e. g. your code is not linted after commit), run ``yarn add husky`` in your project folder.

- You need to [update snapshots](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing#updating-snapshots) and fix failing tests to be able to commit or push your code.
